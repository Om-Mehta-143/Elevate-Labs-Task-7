# 🔐 Task 7 – Browser Extension Threat Audit

> “A browser is a portal — and every extension is a guard or an intruder.”  


---

## 🧭 Objective

Analyze installed browser extensions, identify those that pose security/privacy risks, and remove them to harden browser defenses. The goal was to approach this like a **real-world forensic audit**, not just a checklist.

---

## 🖥️ Platforms Used

- **Primary Browser**: Google Chrome (v124)
- **Secondary Checked**: Mozilla Firefox (v126.0)
- **OS**: Kali Linux 2023.4 (running Google Chrome .deb)
- **Tools**: Native browser extension manager, public threat intel (Reddit, GitHub, forums)

---

---

## 🧠 What I Looked For

- **Unfamiliar names or unused tools**
- **Excessive permissions**
- **Lack of updates**
- **Negative reviews or flagged discussions**
- **Suspicious behavior (e.g., hijacking, redirects)**

---

## 🛡️ How Malicious Extensions Harm

| Vector | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Ad Injection** | Shows pop-ups, redirects traffic |
| **Keylogging** | Steals login credentials |
| **Cookie Theft** | Hijacks session tokens |
| **Browser Hijack** | Forces search engine redirects |
| **Crypto Mining** | Secretly uses CPU without permission |

## 💡 What I Learned

This task made me realize how many extensions I had installed and forgotten about — and how **many had full access to everything I do online**.

Even “helpful” ones like PDF converters or crypto trackers often come from unknown sources and haven’t been updated in years.  
> Going forward, I’ll **treat every extension like an app — only install it if I trust the dev.**

## 📎 Deliverables

- `screenshots` — before/after evidence
- `report.md` — this file

## 🧠 Final Reflection

> *“Extensions can be just as dangerous as malware — they just wear a friendlier face.”*  
This wasn’t just cleanup — it was a mindset shift.
